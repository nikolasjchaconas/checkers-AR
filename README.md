# Checkers AR

Checkers AR is an augmented reality iOS application. The application will use the device camera in order to track the checkerboard. We will use this tracking information to place virtual checker pieces onto the game board. A user can tap on the pieces they see on their phone and their 2D tap will be translated to 3D space so that the tap can correspond to a game piece on the board. Using this, the user can play checkers with a friend.

# Usage

Upon running the application, the user has to first calibrate their camera to the checkerboard. This is necessary to find the intrinsic parameters of the camera so that the pieces can be accurately projected onto the board.

After calibration, the user can tap on the screen of the device to select pieces, and tap again on a valid spot on the game board to move them. Possible moves will be shown by an arrow on the game board to hint the user where they can place their next move.
