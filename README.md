# Checkers AR

Checkers AR is an augmented reality iOS application. The application will use the device camera in order to track game pieces on the checkerboard. We will use this tracking information to place digital images and coloring overlaid on the pieces and game board. The images/coloring will follow pieces as they are moved to a new location on the board throughout gameplay.

# Usage

Upon running the application, the user has to first calibrate their camera to the checkerboard. This is necessary to find the intrinsic parameters of the camera so that the pieces can be accurately projected onto the board

After calibration, the user can tap on the screen of the device to select pieces, and tap again on a valid spot on the game board to move them. Possible moves will be shown by an arrow on the game board.
